# Omniplex — Agent & Contributor Guide

## Project overview

Omniplex is a Discord bot and server list built with **Next.js 16 App Router**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **TypeScript**. The backend API is called **Popplio**; the default base URL is set in `src/lib/api/config.ts` and overridable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (see env var table below — do not hardcode a hostname elsewhere, it will drift). This frontend is intentionally decoupled from the API — swapping the backend means changing `src/lib/api/` only.

---

## Working across the plexicore workspace

This `agents/` directory lives at the root of a multi-repo workspace, not inside any single project — treat it as the shared entry point for every repo below, not an Omniplex-only doc (the rest of this file is still mostly Omniplex-specific detail; add sibling-repo sections here as they need their own standards documented).

Sibling repos, as of this writing:

| Repo | What it is |
|---|---|
| `omniplex/` | This frontend (Next.js). |
| `popplio/` | The Go backend API this frontend talks to. Source of truth for every payload shape — when a frontend type and the backend struct disagree, read the Go struct, don't guess. |
| `arcadia/` | The Rust staff-panel backend (`panel-api`) — both a Discord bot and an axum HTTP microservice. Single-endpoint RPC dispatch (`PanelQuery` tagged union), not REST. Powers `omniplex/src/app/admin`. |
| `infernoplex/` | The Rust Discord bot that tracks/lists servers. Slash-command only; deliberately requests no privileged gateway intents (member/presence data comes from REST, e.g. `with_counts=true` and per-member lookups, not the gateway cache), so it never needs to go through Discord's intent-verification review. |
| `kittycat/` | The permission model shared by Popplio (Go), Arcadia (Rust), and Infernoplex (Rust) as a real dependency, and hand-ported (a deliberately-scoped subset) into Omniplex (`src/lib/permissions.ts`) for client-side UI gating. `namespace.perm` strings, wildcard (`*`)/negator (`~`) semantics, and position-hierarchy resolution (`resolve()`) — implemented independently per language and required to stay behaviorally identical; check its own `CHANGELOG.md`/README before assuming behavior, and update all language implementations together if you touch the resolution algorithm. |
| `botox/` | Shared Rust utility crate (help-command pagination, task scheduling) consumed as a git dependency by Infernoplex and Arcadia. |
| `reedwhisker/` | The legacy Next.js Pages-Router site being replaced by Omniplex. Useful as a reference for what a feature *used* to do, but don't assume it's still correct — it's been wrong or simply absent (e.g. it never had a working "add a server" flow either) more than once. |
| `legacy-panel/` | The old SvelteKit staff panel, superseded by `omniplex/src/app/admin` + `arcadia`. Reference only. |

Each repo keeps its own `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format). Update the changelog in whichever repo(s) you actually touched as part of finishing a task, not as an afterthought — see each changelog's own "Unreleased" version header for the convention (most of these repos aren't tagged/released yet, so everything currently accumulates under the first pending version).

### Cross-repo workflow standards

- **Don't guess a backend contract — read the source.** Before wiring a frontend form/type to an endpoint, read the actual Go struct (Popplio) or Rust type (Arcadia) and its `validate`/`db` tags. Assumptions about field names, required-ness, and enums have been wrong often enough this is a hard rule, not a suggestion.
- **Verify after every edit, every time, no exceptions:**
  - Go: `gofmt -w <files>` then `go build ./...`.
  - TypeScript: `bunx biome check --write <files>` then `bunx tsc --noEmit`.
  - Never report a change as done without having run both.
- **Don't assume backend data is enum-restricted just because the frontend UI looks like a fixed list.** Tags, for example, have never been restricted to an enum server-side — a frontend "pick from these 12" widget was silently hiding real tags outside that list. When building a picker/selector over backend-controlled data, always render values the UI doesn't recognize as visible, removable chips rather than dropping them.
- **Permission/entity catalogs are hand-maintained and drift.** Arcadia has no live permission-catalog endpoint; Omniplex's `STATIC_PERMISSION_CATALOG` is grepped-by-hand from Arcadia's Rust source. Any UI built over such a catalog must surface out-of-catalog values it finds in real data (see `ArcadiaPermSelector`'s "Other granted permissions" pattern) instead of silently hiding them.
- **A UI control's checked/selected state should reflect *effective* truth, not just the one layer being edited.** A permission granted via a staff position and one granted via a per-member override both need to show as "on" — only the override layer is what gets saved, but the checkbox has to reflect the resolved combination or it reads as "the site doesn't respect my actual permissions."
- **Don't fabricate a fix for a live bug report — reproduce it first.** Curl the real API, grep the actual DB-facing Go/Rust code, or write a tiny throwaway script against the real sanitizer/validator function before proposing a fix. Several bugs this session (team votes not resolving, presence not showing, tags not matching) turned out to have a different root cause than the first plausible guess.
- **Security/scope tradeoffs are the user's call, not yours to silently decide.** Things like "allow arbitrary `<iframe>` src" are real, named risks — use `AskUserQuestion` to present the tradeoff and options rather than picking one silently, and don't water down an explicit choice the user already made (e.g. don't sneak in a restrictive `sandbox` attribute after they said "allow any src").

## API layer — how to use and extend

### Using the API in server components (preferred for initial data)

```tsx
import { bots } from "@/lib/api";

export default async function BotPage({ params }) {
  const bot = await bots.getBot(params.id);
  return <div>{bot.user.username}</div>;
}
```

### Using the API in client components (via SWR hooks)

```tsx
import { useBotList } from "@/hooks/useBots";

export default function BotsPage() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useBotList(1);
  ...
}
```

### Calling the API directly in a client component

```tsx
import { client } from "@/lib/api";
const data = await client.get<MyType>("/some/endpoint", { token, cache: "no-store" });
```

### Adding a new resource

1. Create `src/lib/api/resources/myresource.ts`
2. Export functions that call `client.get/post/patch/delete`
3. Add the type shapes to `src/lib/api/types.ts`
4. Re-export from `src/lib/api/index.ts`

### Swapping the backend entirely

1. Update `API_URL` in `src/lib/api/config.ts`
2. Update type shapes in `src/lib/api/types.ts` to match the new API
3. Update resource functions in `src/lib/api/resources/` to match new endpoint paths and request/response shapes
4. Nothing in `components/`, `hooks/`, or `app/` needs to change

---

## Authentication

- Session stored in `localStorage` under the key `wistala` as `{ token, user_id, expires_at }`
- `useAuth` hook reads/writes/clears the session; subscribe to it for reactive auth state
- Auth token is passed as `Authorization: User {token}` by the API client automatically
- OAuth flow: `/auth/login` → Discord → `/auth/sauron?code=...` → `auth.callback(code, client_id, redirectUri)` → `login(session)`. `/auth/callback` is a dead route kept only to redirect old bookmarks back to `/auth/login`.

---

## Styling conventions

- **Colours**: Use `zinc` scale for all neutrals. Never use `gray`, `slate`, or `neutral` unless specifically needed.
- **Dark mode**: Class-based via `next-themes`. Use `dark:` prefix on all colour utilities. Never rely on `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` alone.
- **Spacing**: Prefer Tailwind spacing utilities. No custom CSS unless unavoidable.
- **Borders**: `border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800` for dividers and card borders.
- **Cards**: `rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900`
- **Transitions**: Use `transition-colors` for colour shifts. Avoid heavy animations.
- **Prose / long descriptions**: Apply the `.prose` class. These render HTML from the API.
- **`overflow-x-auto` alone can silently enable vertical scrolling too**: per the CSS spec, setting only `overflow-x` to a non-`visible` value force-computes the other axis to `auto` as well. If you only want horizontal scroll, pair it with an explicit `overflow-y-hidden`.
- **CSS Grid items default to `min-width: auto`**: unwrappable content (a long tag, an unbroken description string) inside a grid item can grow the whole column past its track width and overflow the page horizontally, even though visually each card looks fine on its own. Add `min-w-0` to grid item roots (card components) and to any flex-wrap row inside them that holds variable-width content.

---

## Component conventions

- Server components by default — only add `"use client"` when the component needs hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs.
- Co-locate client-only sub-components with their parent page (e.g. `VoteButton.tsx` next to `page.tsx`).
- Props interfaces use plain TypeScript `interface`, defined at the top of the file.
- No default exports for UI components — use named exports.
- Pages use default exports (required by Next.js).
- **Never render a `<form>` inside a shared/reusable component** (`TagPicker`, `LinksEditor`, etc.) — these get embedded inside page-level `<form>` elements (add/edit pages, edit modals), and a nested `<form>` is invalid HTML that React 19 will hard-error on during hydration. Handle Enter-to-submit with `onKeyDown` on the input and a `type="button"` + `onClick` instead of `type="submit"` in a wrapping `<form>`.
- **No em dashes in user-facing copy** unless there's genuinely no cleaner way to phrase it — prefer a period, "and", or restructuring the sentence.

---

## Error handling

### "Service unavailable" vs generic errors

Two helpers in `src/lib/utils/errors.ts` determine which UI to show:

| Helper | Where used | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `isApiUnavailable(err)` | Server components (`page.tsx`) | `ApiError` with status 502/503/504/408, or `TypeError` (network failure) |
| `isBoundaryApiError(err)` | `error.tsx` client boundaries | `error.name === "ApiError"` or fetch TypeError (serialised by Next.js) |

**Server component pattern** — catch before rendering:
```tsx
try {
  data = await bots.getAll();
} catch (err) {
  if (isApiUnavailable(err)) return <ServiceUnavailable />;
  notFound(); // or throw for unexpected errors
}
```

**Error boundary pattern** — Next.js 16 uses `unstable_retry` (not `reset`):
```tsx
"use client";
export default function MyError({ error, unstable_retry }) {
  if (isBoundaryApiError(error)) return <ServiceUnavailable onRetry={unstable_retry} />;
  return <GenericError onRetry={unstable_retry} />;
}
```

The `ServiceUnavailable` component accepts `inline` (renders as a section, not full-screen) and `onRetry` (calls `unstable_retry` or `window.location.reload`).

---

## Metadata file conventions (Next.js 16)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/robots.ts` | Generates `robots.txt` — allow public routes, disallow `/auth/` and `/api/` |
| `app/sitemap.ts` | Generates `sitemap.xml` — static routes + first page of bots/servers (revalidates hourly) |
| `app/manifest.ts` | Web app manifest for PWA install support |
| `app/opengraph-image.tsx` | Global OG image via `ImageResponse` (1200×630) |
| `app/bots/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` | Per-bot OG image — fetches live bot data |
| `app/servers/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` | Per-server OG image — fetches live server data |

Per-page metadata is set via `export const metadata` (static) or `export async function generateMetadata` (dynamic) in each `page.tsx`. The root layout sets the `title.template` so page titles automatically get `— Omniplex` appended.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://spider-staging.omniplex.gg` | Popplio API base URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` | `https://cdn.omniplex.gg` | Asset CDN base URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Canonical site URL (robots.txt, sitemap, OG images, OAuth redirect URI) |

All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are inlined at `bun run build` time, not read at runtime — see the Deployment section.

---

## Running locally

```bash
bun dev        # start dev server on :3000
bun build      # production build
bun lint       # Biome lint + format check
bun format     # Biome format (write)
```

---

## Deployment

Deployed via [Railpack](https://railpack.com) — config lives in `railpack.json` at the repo root (Bun auto-detected via `bun.lock`). See the README's "Deployment" section for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build-time-vs-runtime env var gotcha before changing env config: those vars are baked in at `bun run build` time, not read at runtime, so they must be set before build, not just before start.

---

## Governance & community docs

`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` exist at the repo root — read those before changing contribution flow, security-disclosure process, or issue templates rather than duplicating that content here. Licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE`), matching the Popplio backend.

---

## What's built vs. what's next

**Do not treat this section as the feature list — it goes stale fast. `CHANGELOG.md` (in this repo and in `popplio/`) is the source of truth for what's actually shipped, kept current as work lands.** This section only tracks structural/architectural notes worth knowing before touching a given area, plus genuinely open decisions.

- **Admin panel** (`/admin`, `src/app/admin/`): built — Discord OAuth + mandatory TOTP MFA login, Bot Queue, entity Search, Staff Positions/Members management, an Arcadia-backed permission system. Talks to **Arcadia** (`arcadia/`), not Popplio directly, via a single-endpoint tagged-union RPC protocol (`src/lib/arcadia/client.ts`). `docs/admin-panel-plan.md` is a historical planning doc from before this was built — check the changelog and the actual code before trusting anything in it about current state.
- **Knowledge base** (`/kb`): built. Articles are `.md` files with YAML frontmatter under `src/content/kb/<category>/<slug>.md` (frontmatter: `title`, `description`, `order`), parsed at request time with `gray-matter` in `src/lib/kb/content.ts` and rendered through the existing sanitized `Markdown` pipeline — no MDX/component execution. Category metadata (title/description/order) lives in `src/lib/kb/categories.ts` since a category isn't itself an article. Routes: `/kb` (landing + client-side search via `KbSearch`), `/kb/[category]` (listing), `/kb/[category]/[slug]` (article, with a persistent `KbSidebar` nav). `/help` and `/help/[category]/[slug]` redirect permanently to `/kb` via `next.config.ts`. Content was ported from reedwhisker's `src/components/guide/articles/` tree, excluding everything under `legal/` (superseded by nodebyte.co.uk's legal pages) — do not port reedwhisker's toggle-sidebar `HelpCenter.tsx` (it violates the rules of hooks) or its other bespoke components. To add an article: drop a new `.md` file with frontmatter in the right category folder; to add a category, add an entry to `KB_CATEGORIES` and a matching directory.
- **Reviews, Packs (bot+server), server presence, "add a server"**: all built this cycle — see the changelog for exact scope. Notably, **`delete_server` has no backend route in Popplio** despite a frontend resource function existing for it — don't wire up server-deletion UI without adding that endpoint first.
- **Open**: no staff moderation path exists yet for reviews (no force-delete RPC), and no server queue/approval flow exists in Arcadia (only bots have one) — servers currently list immediately rather than going through review.
